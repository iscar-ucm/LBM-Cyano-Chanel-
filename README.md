# LBM fluid + cellDEVS cyanobacteria simulation
This is a repository containing the code referenced in the paper "Simulation of cyanobacteria behavior in water bodies with cell-DEVS and Lattice-Boltzmann methods" presented in ANNSIM'25 by Ferrero-Losada et al.

Here are contained both the fluid LBM simulation and the cellular automata simulation of cell-DEVS. However, to run the latter, xDEVS v3.0.0 must be installed first from its own repository.
